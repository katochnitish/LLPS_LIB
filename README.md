Welcome to the GitHub repository for the data and plots used in the manuscript titled "AI for Biophysical Phenomena: A Comparative Study of ChatGPT and Gemini in Explaining Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation". This repository contains datasets, analytical scripts, and visualizations that support the findings and discussions presented in the manuscript.

In our study, we compare the capabilities of two advanced AI models, ChatGPT and Gemini, in explaining and predicting the behavior observed in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) phenomena. This comparative analysis aims to highlight the strengths and limitations of AI technologies in biophysical research contexts.
